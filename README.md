# raspberry-piano
This is a school raspberry pi project, which realizes a keyboard piano. 
The piano is playing sounds on each keystroke and it does send light signals to the determined lamps on the breadboard.
The piano exists of a website hosted on the raspberry pi and of a construction on a breadboard.

## Website
Some nice animation also happen on each pressed or clicked keystroke
